/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the PULSE disaster alert system.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and alerts, while disaster events and insights are accessible based on broader authorization (e.g., service accounts, admin roles - not implemented in this prototype). The rules prioritize security by default, explicitly denying access where not explicitly granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/alerts/{alertId}: Alerts specific to a user, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /disasterEvents/{disasterEventId}: Disaster event data, broadly accessible (read) but write-protected in this prototype.
 * - /disasterEvents/{disasterEventId}/insights/{insightId}: AI-generated insights related to disaster events, inheriting the access control of the parent event.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles and alerts are strictly owned by the authenticated user (path-based ownership).
 * - Disaster events are read-accessible by anyone, but write-protected. In a production environment, write access would be granted to service accounts or admin roles.
 * - Listing of disaster events is allowed for all users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The alerts subcollection denormalizes disaster event data to avoid `get()` calls and enforce authorization independence. This allows security rules to be based solely on the data present in the `alert` document and the user's ID, eliminating hierarchical dependencies.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles and disaster events are stored in separate collections to enforce different security requirements.
