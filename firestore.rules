/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the PULSE disaster alert system.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and alerts, while allowing open read access to disaster events.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Alerts are stored under `/users/{userId}/alerts/{alertId}`.
 * - Disaster events are stored under `/disasterEvents/{disasterEventId}`.
 * - AI Insights are stored under `/disasterEvents/{disasterEventId}/insights/{insightId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data and alerts.
 * - Disaster events are publicly readable.
 * - Listing user profiles is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `alerts` subcollection under each user profile denormalizes relevant information from the `DisasterEvent` to avoid `get()` calls.
