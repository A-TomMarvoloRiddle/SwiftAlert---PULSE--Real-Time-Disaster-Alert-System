/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the PULSE disaster alert system.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and alerts, while allowing more permissive access to disaster event data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts specific to each user.
 * - /disasterEvents/{disasterEventId}: Stores global disaster event information.
 * - /disasterEvents/{disasterEventId}/insights/{insightId}: Stores AI-generated insights for each disaster event.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles and alerts are strictly owned by the authenticated user.
 * - Disaster events are accessible for reading by anyone, but write access is implicitly denied because no `allow write` rules have been created and enabled.
 * - Listing disaster events is permitted.
 * - Listing insights is implicitly denied because no `allow list` rules have been created and enabled.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Alerts are denormalized to include disaster event data, allowing for authorization checks without requiring additional reads.
